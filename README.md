## 1. Introduction
The Data Cleaner Extension for Ulaa Browser is a tool designed to enhance your privacy and manage your cookies, localstorage, and history effectively. 
It has a feature for domain-based filtering and deletion. 
> It allows you to target specific websites or domains for cleaning cookies, local storage, and history.


### The Importance of Clearing Cookies, Storage, and History

**Cookies:** Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device to remember your preferences and login information. While they can be useful, they can also be used to track your online activities. Clearing cookies regularly helps protect your online privacy and prevents advertisers from building detailed profiles about your behavior.

**Local Storage:** Websites use local storage to store data on your device, which can include sensitive information. Clearing local storage ensures that websites do not retain your personal data without your consent.

**Browsing History:** Your browsing history contains a record of the websites you've visited and the searches you've made. Clearing your history helps maintain your privacy and keeps your online activities confidential.

#### - Preventing Cross-Site Tracking
Clearing cookies can help prevent cross-site tracking, where data is shared across different websites to create a comprehensive profile of your online behavior. This type of tracking can be invasive and compromise your privacy.

#### - Protecting Your Credentials
If you're using a shared computer or a public device, clearing cookies and browsing history helps ensure that your login credentials and sensitive information are not accessible to others.

#### - Customized Browsing
Clearing cookies can also have the benefit of allowing you to start with a clean slate when you revisit websites. This can be useful when you want to see content as if you were a new visitor or if you've encountered website issues due to corrupted or outdated cookies.

> This documentation will help you understand how to install, configure, and use this extension to keep your browser clean and protect your online privacy.

## 3. Use Case 
Use Case for cookie deletion using “DATA CLEANER EXTENSION”

    Consider a scenario where you have logged in to multiple websites through the course of your tasks, and at the end of the day, you need to log out. Typically, clearing the stored cookies on your browser will log you out of these websites. But, doing so will also log you out of ‘ALL’ of those sessions. If you wanted to logout of some sessions and retains some sessions, you would be unable to do that, because conventional cookie clearing extensions/tools will clear ‘ALL’ the stored cookies on your system. There is no way to choose which cookies you’d want to keep and what to remove. This is where ‘DATA CLEANER EXTENSION’ plays its part. 

This extension allows you to clear cookies selectively, by virtue of its domain-based filtering. You can mention the domains whose cookies you want to remove, and the extension will delete all the cookies from that specific domain and retain the rest.
